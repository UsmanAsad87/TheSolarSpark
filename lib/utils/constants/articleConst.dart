Incline towards Allāh in a repentance that becomes a guidance for the future; it is likely that your Lord will relieve you of your sins and admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow - on the day when Allāh will not humble the Prophet and the believers along with him” [Tahrīm 66:8]\nRasoolAllah ﷺ said: “Every son of Adam commits sin, and the best of those who commit sin are those who repent” [Sunan ibn Majah]. Only the Prophets and Angels are free from all sin; the rest of creation can and do sin. Therefore, if a sin is committed, we must not delay our repentance and turn back to Almighty Allāh immediately.\nTaubah comes from the Arabic root word meaning ‘to return’. When we repent to Almighty Allāh we are returning the soul to its spiritual state of purity. Do not forget, Almighty Allāh loves our repentance! The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said: \"By the One in whose hand my soul is! If you do not commit sins, Almighty Allāh would replace you with a people who would commit sins and seek forgiveness from Almighty Allāh; and Almighty Allāh will certainly forgive them.\" [Tirmidhi]\nFurthermore, Almighty Allāh is so merciful that if you repent with sincerity, He will convert the sins into rewards as stated in the Qur'ān al Karīm:\nإِلَّا مَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ عَمَلًا صَـٰلِحًا فَأُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ يُبَدِّلُ ٱللَّهُ سَيِّـَٔاتِهِمْ حَسَنَـٰتٍ ۗ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا\n\n“Except one who repents and accepts faith and does good deeds – so Allah will turn their evil deeds into virtues; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Furqan 25:70]\n\nThe beginning of any spiritual progression is Taubah; therefore, for us to be properly equipped and prepared for the future, we must repent from all the sins we have committed in the past, as stated in the aforementioned verse of the Qur'ān al Karīm. Taubah is so powerful that RasoolAllah ﷺ stated that “The one who repents from sin is like the one who has not sinned.” [Ibn Majah]\n\nImagine a person is travelling on a path and each sin he or she commits along the way represents a burden on their shoulders. The more that person sins the heavier the burden becomes making it difficult to progress forward. If Taubah is delayed or he or she procrastinates, the burden of sins will continue to increase making it more and more difficult to remove. However, as soon as a sin is committed, if a person sincerely repents to Almighty Allāh, the burden will be removed as they travel along the path making it easier for them to progress. Let us not forget, we are all on a path to attain the nearness of Almighty Allāh."),

Almighty Allāh cannot tell a lie, so the prayer itself has the power to stop one from sinning but the question one should ask themselves is, “Am I even fulfilling the requirements of Salāh for it to protect me from indecency and evil?” Salāh itself is a combination of 2 things:\n\n\t1.    Physical form (Jism) - The physical form of Salāh includes the physical actions performed, such as standing and sitting in prayer, the recitation, bowing and prostration etc according to the Sunnah.\n\n\t2.    Spiritual form (Ruh) - To maintain complete concentration and presence of the heart (Khushū’ and Khudhū’) throughout Salāh.\n\nFulfilling both elements is essential for the perfection of Salāh. For example, an individual may shed tears due to concentration in Salāh but an incorrect recitation (Tajwīd) may render the Salāh invalid. Others may have perfected their actions but thinking about worldly matters during their Salāh renders it defective.\n\nThe fulfilment of both elements is emphasised in the following narration. It was narrated from Sayyiduna Hudhaifah (RadiAllāhu Anhu) that he saw a man praying but his bowing and prostration were improper and he said to him, “How long have you been praying like this?” The man said: “For forty years.” Sayyiduna Hudhaifah (RadiAllāhu Anhu) responded by saying that, “You have not been praying for forty years and if you die praying like this, you will have died following a path other than the path of Muhammad ﷺ.” Then he added: “It is possible for a man to pray briefly, but still do it properly.” [An Nasā‘ī]\n\nWhilst learning the physical form of Salāh is often heavily emphasised, it is the spiritual form which can get neglected.  Therefore, Kanz ul Huda offers a simple method to establish concentration in Salāh"),

//                 "1)  Learn the translation of Salāh. Our prayer is a direct communication with Almighty Allāh. We speak to Almighty Allāh in each prayer, but many do not even know what they are saying. For this reason, it is imperative to memorise the translation and focus on what is being said to Almighty Allāh.\n\n2)  Know that the angels are descending from the heavens and are surrounding the person during the prayer as mentioned in Hadith Qudsi:\n\n“Almighty Allāh has supernumerary angels who rove about seeking out gatherings in which Allah's name is being invoked. Once found, they sit with them and fold their wings round each other, filling that which is between them and between the lowest heaven.”\n\n3)  Envisage the name of Almighty Allāh in front of you or engraved on the heart. Although one cannot see Almighty Allāh, He can surely see us.")
